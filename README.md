# 3-axis_robotic_hand
For this project, I utilized various tools such as Arduino, servo motors, DC motors, SolidWorks, etc. to construct a 3-axis robotic hand that can be controlled by adjusting potentiometers associated with the X, Y, and Z axes, with the end effector starting from a fixed position that can serve as the origin, and the program can be customized using inverse kinematics to enable the hand to move to specific points in space based on the X, Y, and Z coordinates.

limitations: usage of servos were reduced becuase of the signal interference
